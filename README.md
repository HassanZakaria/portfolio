# Hassan's Portfolio

This Portfolio was created using create-react-app to showcase my experience so far, what I've learned as a self-taught React developer, and what I hope to achieve in the next couple of months.<br>

Deployed site can be found at: ***https://hassanzakaria.netlify.app***<br>

Material-UI was used for creating the drawer for smaller screens and for the cards which I used to display the necessary info about me. For the icons I used FontAwesome.<br>

React Router was used to navigate between pages components.
